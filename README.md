## Story
Flynn 'Slayer' Taggart is the man who is primarily responsible for failing Hel's invasion. With the Baphomet defeated, the UAC assigned a special TAO team to Flynn, with only one objective: wipe out all demons. They've got the best weaponry available, designed for taking on entire hordes of demons and are often deployed to dispatch packs that would prove too lethal for standard squadrons.

Flynn's team has been assigned to an overrun jungle base which contains trans-dimensional technology, as the last thing the Earth needs is yet another invasion. This elite squadron proves instrumental, obliterating the army within. But the tech suffers damage during the fight. The portal malfunctions and sucks everything nearby into it - which happens to include Flynn, who flies uncontrollably through the wormhole and loses consciousness.

Waking up on the other side, he discovers he's still on Earth at least. But the base he arrived at is on partial lockdown, and he lost all his weapons in transit. Greeting him on the comms is Enterblathnir, who informs him at the briefing room that all personnel are currently down at the lake, him included. A massive Hellfire portal had opened and all hands were needed to deal with it. 

Per Enterblathnir's instructions, he secures a gun and goes to deal with the portal, but after some fighting, the portal expands and sends in bigger demons. Holding fast, he is reinforced by Enterblathnir and his men, eliminating the larger wave and securing the base. The Colonel helps him establish contact with his own squad, who indicate they're 7448 miles away by how long it takes for the radio waves to reach them. Confirming they're en route, it's estimated to take around half a day or more to reach them with global teleporters, since most of them were disabled, and they're expecting to have to make repairs.

Asking Flynn for a personal favor while he's waiting, Enterblathnir informs him their resources have been stretched thin, almost to breaking point. Manpower, munitions, and morale are all running on fumes since demons have been repeatedly assaulting them for the past few weeks. His plan is to pull back most of the marines and form two tight parameters around the military base and radio tower in an effort to boost morale and security, while giving Flynn access to the bigger weapons once repairs are done, along with some 'new toys' the lab boys are working on.

However, some things are best left to the unknown...
...but you'll never when the unknown will rise to strike. Perhaps it's best to strike first.

## Events
Unlike standard Doom levels, you'll be patrolling between multiple zones and eliminating demonic threats throughout the region. Completing these events rewards several things, but most importantly, it gives time, which progresses the game. Events pop up on HUD whenever something interesting is going on, and will lead the way to an objective.

Hellfire Portals are the primary events and are the most common. These are mandatory and must be completed, lest the demons overwhelm and take out the military base of the radio tower. If either of these fall, you fail the game.

Mandatory events may rarely occur multiple times at once, so make sure to manage your situation appropriately.

Optional events have a time limit before they expire and cannot be completed. Usually they'll appear again after some time and they give bigger rewards, in exchange for risking life, limb and time to complete them.

## Mechanics
At some point during the campaign, a Hellfire Backpack becomes available that not only extends ammunition pockets, it also grants *offensive* and *defensive* abilities that require fuel.
* **Hellfire** fuels offense: casting powerful attacks, enhancing regular weapon attacks for players and allies, restoring ammo, or causing mass destruction.
* **Darkfire** fuels defense: damage reduction + regeneration for allies, Hellfire projectile absorption, invulnerability, or health/armor restoration.

Hellfire drops primarily from demons, while Darkfire drops primarily from Terrorfiends.

## Factions
* **Humans** are the native individuals who own Silkwood Mountains. They are fragile and irreplaceable when slain, but are clever and pack a big punch with their weapons - sometimes to the detriment of themselves. They are at war with __demons__ and cannot damage their allies. When a human is incapacitated, another human not in combat or the player can revive them before they're killed. They can give each other health, armor, ammo and weaponry to protect and reinforce themselves for combat. They target any other faction without preference, but seek to quell the biggest threats first.
* **Demons** are an invasive species from the world called Hel. Their true motives are unknown, but their violent actions make clear a desire for conquest. Rage-filled beasts that are brimming with Hellfire, what they lack in brains, they make up for with brawn and seemingly endless numbers who can overwhelm their foes simply with sheer numbers. Different species of demon can infight with one another, but same species demons won't. They prefer human targets without care for how dangerous any single human could be.
* **Terrorfiends** are rare monsters that only spawn when corruption starts seeping into the region. Their numbers are very few, and one should be thankful for that; they move fast, hit hard, and are nigh invulnerable. However, they lack range, can easily be outsmarted since they act purely on instinct, and Hellfire can damage them. They have a *super* preference for targeting demons; so long as a non-demon target doesn't deal damage to them, they'll peel off and switch to attacking demons upon sighting them.
* **Abyss** are best left to the unknown... What's known is they're territorial and do not hunt past their self-established boundaries. But any trespassers, including their own kind, are free game. With the amount of violence and bloodshed they inflict, one should stay clear of them at all costs, lest they become a tragedy.

Can you survive the onslaught of evil? Or will your first death be your last?
