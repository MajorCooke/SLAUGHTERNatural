Description             : 

"Everyone has a story. Some stories-"
"-Come before the one you're about to tell. Some after."
"...Who are you?"
"The least of your concerns, Dark."
"......"
"The name's Mekhan. Think of me as an admirer."
"What are you comprised of?"
"I am a soul clad in pure Hellfire."
"...But-"
"You're unfamiliar with this kind because it's not of your dimension. Mine is 
 pure darkness and made of antimatter. The way you portray your demons strikes me
 as... alien. "
"...Do you have a story you'd like to tell?"
"No."
"Then why are you here?"
"To write one."
"...I-"
"With you."
"..."
"Baphomet has portrayed you, the Demon Annihilation Resonator 2K as the end of 
 all things human and demon. Maybe you are. Or maybe there's more than meets the
 eye. He fed you Hellfire once to assist with Cybergaze and you're still working 
 towards it after a time. Seems time has changed his tune about you, and then you 
 piss him off again. Hahah, you are a truly interesting fellow!"
"..."
"So lets talk about that dimensional breach you briefly
 touched upon, that happened before Sylveus showed up."
"I had forgotten about that one actually..."
"Let us see this story together, shall we?"
"I prefer to do this alone but... Perhaps having another
 to journey with will be helpful."
"Then we shall begin."

	And thus begins the story of how the Slayer arrived at Silkwood Mountain
	Range, and fought against a host of demons and nightmares while adapting
	Hellfire to spread devastation to those who would do harm to humanity.
	
	It all began when his team arrived to shut down a portal in an abandoned
	jungle base that malfunctioned and sucked him in. Saved by Dark, he finds
	himself in the company of Enterblathnir & co. Now he must help the people
	while awaiting his team to arrive.
